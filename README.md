2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables:
   - A `.env.example` file is provided as a template

### Running the App

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# Run on iOS simulator
npm run ios
# or
yarn ios

# Run on Android emulator
npm run android
# or
yarn android

# Run on web browser
npm run web
# or
yarn web
```

## Building for Production

### Prerequisites for EAS Builds
- Expo Account (create at https://expo.dev/)
- EAS CLI installed (`npm install -g eas-cli`)
- Logged in to EAS (`eas login`)

### First-time EAS Setup
1. Run `eas login` to log in to your Expo account
2. Run `eas build --platform android --profile release` to start the build
3. When prompted, confirm creating a new EAS project
4. When prompted, confirm generating a new Android Keystore (for new projects)
5. Wait for the build to complete

### Building APK for Direct Distribution
To generate an APK file that can be sent directly to someone (not for store distribution):

```bash
# Build APK for direct distribution
eas build --platform android --profile release

# Build APK for preview/testing
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

The build will generate an APK file that can be downloaded and installed directly on Android devices without going through the Google Play Store.

### EAS Configuration Profiles
- **preview**: Generates an APK for testing and direct distribution
- **release**: Generates an APK for direct distribution (internal)
- **production**: Generates an App Bundle for Google Play Store submission

### Android

```bash
# Build for Android using EAS (requires Expo account)
eas build --platform android --profile release

# Build for Android with development profile
eas build --platform android --profile development

# Build for Android with preview profile
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### iOS

```bash
# Build for iOS using EAS (requires Expo account and Apple Developer account)
eas build --platform ios --profile release

# Build for iOS with development profile
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Build for iOS with preview profile
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

### Web

```bash
# Export for web deployment
npm run build:web
# or
yarn build:web
```

## EAS Configuration

The project uses EAS (Expo Application Services) for building and deploying mobile apps:

- **Development**: For internal testing with development client
- **Preview**: For internal distribution (TestFlight/App Store Connect)
- **Production**: For App Store/Google Play distribution
- **Release**: For direct store distribution with app bundle generation

To set up EAS for the first time:
1. Run `eas login` to log in to your Expo account
2. Run `eas build --platform android --profile release` to start the build
3. Follow the prompts to configure the EAS project if needed
